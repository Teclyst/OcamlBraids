# OcamlBraids

A software that implements algorithms for Garside groups, and braid groups in particular, written in OCaml.

This was originally meant to showcase how Jae Joon Cha's and Juan Gonzalez-Meneses' Cbraid could be rewritten in a generic way (and also the power of first order modules), before I started working on the original C++ project.

There are currently no plans for further development, as the main project remains the C++ version, and getting good performance constitutes a good incentive to choose a system language.

Furthermore, it also competes with a Rust version of the same thing for the "rewrite it in an actually good language" spot.
